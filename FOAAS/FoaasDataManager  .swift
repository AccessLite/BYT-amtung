/*
 The goal of the data manager is to save [FoaasOperation] (making sure that your DataConvertible conformance is working) to user defaults, load the [FoaasOperation] and return a Bool to indicate success, and to delete all stored [FoaasOperation].
 Requirements 1. Keep your calls to the AppDelegate 2. Check to see if you can load stored [FoaasOperation] before you attempt to make an API call to store them. 3. Take special care to adhere to DRY principles.
